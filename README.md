# Monster Jobs
Search for jobs in the command line from monster.com. You can search for a job description and/or a job location (note that monster.com only includes jobs in America). The first approximatley 30 search results are put in a database using sqlite3 and are shown on the screen. You can use another command to go to the 
link of any of the results stored in a database. Note that you have to clear the database using the --clear command and that jobs searches may be duplicated as
of now.

## Note
More work to be done here.
